Privacy Policy
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Collected

In the course of operating our system, we collect the following Personally Identifiable Information (PII):

Usernames: To identify the individual initiating actions within the system.

IP Addresses: To log the source of requests and ensure security of the system.

Timestamps: To track the exact time of each command sent to the robot, enabling a comprehensive audit trail for accountability and safety compliance.

Purpose of Collection

The data is collected to meet the GDPR requirement of maintaining a secure and auditable system. Specifically, the audit trail is necessary to satisfy safety and operational audits of the Ground Control Station. It ensures that every action within the system is traceable back to the user who performed it, which supports accountability and transparency in our processes.

Data Security

All PII collected is securely stored and accessed under strict role-based access control (RBAC) policies. Only individuals with "Auditor" roles are authorized to access the audit log. This ensures that the data is safeguarded against unauthorized access and is only used for the intended purpose of safety auditing. The audit logs are retained only for as long as necessary to meet audit and compliance requirements and are securely deleted once no longer needed.
